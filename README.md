# ü¶† What can Sophther.exe do? ü¶†
Sophther has 3 releases: 32-bit, 64-bit and GDI only.



The 32-bit version is for systems running Windows XP 32-bit.

The 64-bit version is... you know already.
> [!WARNING]
> Running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit Windows XP version will not make it a critical process!

Sophther can overwrite the MBR, set itself a critical process, copy itself to system directories, set a random date and move the cursor. It also plays bytebeat audio and displays mesmerizing GDI effects.


# ‚ù§Ô∏è For Skidders ‚ù§Ô∏è
Some of you may use this code without my or Venra's permission, so in order to prevent that, I added a GNU AGPL-3.0 licence, so that way, if you ever use its source code, you must credit me, release the source code of your project and set the same licence for your project. I added the source code here for newcomers to learn GDI, not to open the skid door!
